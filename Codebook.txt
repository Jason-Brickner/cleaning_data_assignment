Codebook for variable names
==============================

Subject: individual whose measurements were used.

Activity: six different categories of activities analyzed in the data (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING).

Variables are from accelerometer data.  They are either time domain signals (with the prefix t) or Fast Fourier Transforms of the data (with the prefix f).  

Acceleration data are from either body or gravity measurements. These measurements are broken down into either linear or angular accelerations.  

Jerk signals are derived from both the linear and angular accelerations.  

Finally, measurements that are in a single dimension (X, Y or Z) are indicated.

mean = mean of data
std = standard deviation
